# Shared commanderhub daemon registry across observer instances

**Issue:** [#49](https://github.com/agentserver/loom/issues/49) — commanderhub daemon registry not shared across observer instances; the commander UI shows daemons intermittently when the observer scales horizontally.

## Context

The observer deploys with `replicaCount: 2` in dev (`deploy/charts/observer/values.yaml:1`) and `replicaCount: 3` in production (`values-production.example.yaml:1`). The commanderhub `Hub` keeps every live daemon WebSocket in a per-process map (`internal/commanderhub/registry.go:86-93`). A `daemon-link` WS is naturally sticky — it lands on one pod and stays there — but the read paths the commander UI uses (`GET /api/commander/daemons`, `/tree`, `/sessions`, `POST /daemons/{id}/sessions/{sid}/turn`) are plain stateless HTTP requests. The load balancer routes each one to an arbitrary pod, and that pod can only see the daemons whose WS happened to land on it. The result, observed in production at `loom.nj.cs.ac.cn:10062`:

- A user with one driver-agent + one slave-agent sees the daemon list change on every refresh.
- `POST .../turn` returns 404 whenever the request lands on a non-owning pod.
- Daemon TCP connections and stderr stay healthy throughout — the bug is purely on the observer side.

The fix shares enough state between observer pods that any pod can answer any commander HTTP request consistently. The v3 scope **closes every observable read inconsistency** — not just the daemon list, but the per-daemon session list and turn state too. Specifically: daemon registry shared via Postgres, command/turn forwarded to the WS-owning pod over an internal HTTP listener, `turnStateStore` is replaced with a Postgres-backed implementation, `sessionListCache` is disabled in shared mode (it's a 10s in-memory cache whose cross-pod invalidation cost dwarfs its single-pod hit-rate benefit). Multi-pod turn-in-flight dedup falls out of the shared turn-state.

## Approach

Four layers:

1. **Postgres-backed registry of online daemons** (`commander_daemons` table). Owner pod UPSERTs on connect, heartbeats every 15 s with `WHERE owning_instance_url=$pod` ownership guard, DELETEs on graceful disconnect (also guarded), and sweeps rows older than 5 min. Reads (`/daemons`, `/tree`, `/sessions`) consult this table.

2. **Internal pod-to-pod command forwarding** over a **separate dedicated listener** (`:8091` by default) that is **never exposed by Ingress/HTTPRoute**. Auth: HMAC over `(timestamp, nonce, body)` with a 60 s window and a Postgres-backed nonce table (replay-proof within the window, fail-closed on PG unavailable). Supports current+previous secret pair for three-phase rotation. Wire format: length-prefixed JSON envelopes capped at **1 MiB per envelope (matches existing `wsReadLimit`) and 1.5 MiB per forward request body** — see "Wire sizing" below; daemon-side encoded-size enforcement keeps envelopes within the cap.

3. **Postgres-backed `turnStateStore`** (`commander_turns` table). Owner pod's `routeFrame` is the single writer: it interprets each envelope using a stored `pendingEntry.command` + session id, runs the existing turn-state machine, and UPSERTs the row. Read paths (`tree.go::cachedSessionRows`, etc.) read by `(owner, short_id, session_id)`. `turns.begin()` becomes a row-level lock via `INSERT … ON CONFLICT … WHERE state IN ('idle','done','error','awaiting_approval','disconnected')`.

4. **`sessionListCache` disabled when shared mode is active.** The cache exists to spare daemons repeated `list_sessions` traffic when a UI tab refreshes quickly; the cost in shared mode (cross-pod invalidation, stale lists for up to 10s) is worse than just paying the daemon hit. In single-pod mode the cache stays exactly as-is.

5. **Identity-cache TTL skew across pods** (v10, from comment 4839308595; v11 corrections):

   `internal/identity/cache.go`'s `cacheResolver` caches `(token → Identity)` per pod for `FreshTTL=180s` with `StaleGrace=15m`. In multi-pod mode, a token revoked by agentserver continues to be accepted by pod-B for up to 180 s after pod-A's cache expires and re-fetches a deny; the window is exactly the per-pod `FreshTTL`.

   **v11 fix:**
   - In shared mode, default `FreshTTL` lowers to 30s; the chart bakes 30s into `values-production.example.yaml`.
   - New opt-in: `identity.agentserver.revocation_channel: postgres`. When set, every pod's `cacheResolver` does TWO things:
     - **Subscribes** to PG `LISTEN observer_identity_revoke` on a **dedicated** `*pgx.Conn` (single-conn handle; `pgx.Conn` is not goroutine-safe and `WaitForNotification` blocks the conn).
     - **Publishes** `NOTIFY observer_identity_revoke '<tok_hash>'` on the existing `*sql.DB` pool (separate connection, no contention with the LISTEN goroutine). The pool already exists in observer-server; no new dep.
   - **Publish policy (codex v11-r2 M#3 fix):**
     - On `identity.ErrRevoked` (HTTP 403 from upstream): publish unconditionally. Revocations are rare and operator-initiated; PG NOTIFY fanout per revocation is acceptable cost.
     - On `identity.ErrInvalid` (HTTP 401 / malformed / unknown token): **publish ONLY if** the token's hash is currently in this pod's local cache (`c.entries[tokenKey(token)]` exists). Rationale: a random invalid bearer the cluster has never seen should not amplify into N×NOTIFY traffic; only invalidations of formerly-valid tokens propagate. Combined with a per-pod rate limit of 100 publishes/second (drop excess + WARN log), an attacker spamming bad tokens cannot DoS the LISTEN channel.
   - Receivers (including the publishing pod) `LISTEN` and on each notification call `c.evict(tok_hash)` — a new method that deletes the entry from `c.entries`/`c.lru` if present (no-op if missing).
   - **NOTIFY payload size:** `tok_hash` is the SHA-256 hex digest used internally as the cache key (`tokenKey(token)` at `cache.go`). 64 hex chars; well under the Postgres NOTIFY payload limit of 8000 bytes.
   - **Duplicate publishes:** multiple pods publishing the same revocation in the same window is harmless — each LISTEN receiver does an idempotent `evict`; the NOTIFY channel is fire-and-forget.

6. **`authstore.NewInMemoryStore()` selected in multi-pod deployments** (v10, from comment 4839308595; v11 split into binary + chart layers):

   `cmd/observer-server/main.go::buildCommanderAuthStore` (line 281) falls back to in-memory store when `cfg.Store.Driver` is `"sqlite"` or empty. In multi-pod the in-memory store breaks commander login (login token issued on pod-A → poll lands on pod-B with empty store → user sees an indefinite login spinner).

   **v11 fix — two-layer enforcement:**
   - **Binary `validateConfig`** can only see what's in observer.yaml, NOT `replicaCount` (which is a chart concern). Rule: `cluster.enabled AND store.driver != "postgres"` → fatal `"cluster mode requires store.driver=postgres for authstore consistency"`. This already exists in v9 (under the "Cluster config" section); v11 retains it.
   - **Chart `templates/validate.yaml`** has full visibility of `.Values.replicaCount`. New rule: `replicaCount > 1 AND store.driver != "postgres"` → fail-fast with `"replicaCount > 1 requires store.driver=postgres (in-memory authstore breaks commander login under load balancing)"`. This catches the misconfig at `helm install` time, before any pod ever starts.
   - Operator who sets `replicaCount > 1` without `cluster.enabled=true` (i.e., scaling out the observer without using shared registry) gets caught by the existing chart rule `replicaCount > 1 + cluster.enabled=false → fail`. So all three loops close: (a) `>1 + sqlite` fails at chart render; (b) `>1 + postgres + cluster.disabled` fails at chart render; (c) `>1 + postgres + cluster.enabled + binary doesn't see postgres` fails at binary startup.

7. **`Hub.cmdSeq` per-pod sequence collisions in cross-pod debugging** (v10/v12 from comment 4839308595): `hub.go:33`'s `atomic.Int64` counter is incremented per pod, so two pods both produce `"1"`, `"2"`, `"z"`, etc. — base-36 of the same small integers. After a forwarding hop, debug logs across both pods show the same cmdID for unrelated commands, making it impossible to correlate a stuck request.

   **Fix v12:** in shared mode (`h.sharedReg != nil`), `nextCmdID` emits `<podHash>-<base36-seq>` where `podHash = hex(sha256(advertiseURL))[:4]`. In **single-pod mode (h.sharedReg == nil)**, `nextCmdID` is **exactly unchanged**: emits `"1"`, `"2"`, etc. (no prefix, no trailing dash). This preserves byte-for-byte compatibility with existing tests and log parsers in the single-pod default path.

8. **Finding E — telemetry rate limiter is per-pod** (v13, from issue #49 final audit):

   `internal/observerweb/rate_limit.go::telemetryLimiter` is a per-process in-memory token bucket map keyed by `(workspace_id, agent_id, telemetry_key_id)` (`server.go:203-207`). With `per_minute=60, burst=120` configured on N pods, the **effective global quota is `N × per_minute` and burst is `N × burst`** — the configured value loses meaning under horizontal scale. Worse, ops have no visible signal: a workspace might appear to be hitting the configured 60/min while actually pushing 180/min through 3 pods.

   **Fix v13:** in **shared mode** only, swap `*telemetryLimiter` for a Postgres-backed token bucket that atomically refills + decrements in a single SQL statement, keyed identically. Single-pod mode keeps the in-memory limiter unchanged.

   New table `commander_telemetry_buckets`. **Composite PK** (codex v13 BLOCKER #2): the existing in-memory limiter keys are `workspace_id + "\x00" + agent_id + "\x00" + telemetry_key_id`; Postgres `text` cannot contain NUL bytes, so we split into three explicit columns:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS commander_telemetry_buckets (
       workspace_id      text             NOT NULL,
       agent_id          text             NOT NULL,
       telemetry_key_id  text             NOT NULL,
       tokens            double precision NOT NULL,
       last_refilled     timestamptz      NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
       updated_at        timestamptz      NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
       PRIMARY KEY (workspace_id, agent_id, telemetry_key_id)
   );
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS commander_telemetry_buckets_updated_idx
       ON commander_telemetry_buckets (updated_at);
   ```

   The atomic allow check (codex v13 BLOCKER #1 fix — refill computed from `b.tokens` in the existing row, NOT `EXCLUDED.tokens`):

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO commander_telemetry_buckets AS b (workspace_id, agent_id, telemetry_key_id, tokens, last_refilled, updated_at)
   VALUES ($workspace, $agent, $tkid, $burst::double precision - 1, $now, $now)
   ON CONFLICT (workspace_id, agent_id, telemetry_key_id) DO UPDATE
     SET tokens = LEAST(
                    b.tokens + (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ($now - b.last_refilled)) / 60.0) * $perMinute,
                    $burst::double precision
                  ) - 1,
         last_refilled = $now,
         updated_at    = $now
     WHERE LEAST(
             b.tokens + (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM ($now - b.last_refilled)) / 60.0) * $perMinute,
             $burst::double precision
           ) >= 1
   RETURNING tokens
   ```

   - INSERT path (no conflict): the bucket is created with `$burst - 1` tokens — this is the **first-ever request** for this key; only the first request post-creation gets to start near burst. The reused `$burst - 1` is correct here because there's no row to refill from.
   - UPDATE path (conflict): refill is computed from `b.tokens` (the EXISTING row), not from `EXCLUDED.tokens` (the proposed insert) — that was v13's bug.
   - Concurrency safety: PG row-level lock on the conflicting row serializes concurrent UPSERTs; both the refill computation in the SET and the gating in the WHERE see the post-lock view of `b.tokens` / `b.last_refilled`. Two concurrent calls cannot both pass the `WHERE` check with the same tokens — one sees the bucket pre-decrement, the other sees it post-decrement.
   - Rows returned > 0 ⇒ token granted (request allowed).
   - 0 rows returned ⇒ no token available (request denied with HTTP 429, same as today).

   **Failure modes** (codex v13 MAJOR #3 — error must be distinguishable from "denied"):
   - **`allow` signature:** `(allowed bool, err error)`. The handler distinguishes three outcomes:
     - `allow → (true, nil)`: request proceeds.
     - `allow → (false, nil)`: bucket exhausted → HTTP 429 (same as today).
     - `allow → (_, err != nil)`: PG unavailable, `lock_timeout` hit (PG error code `55P03`), context cancelled, etc. → HTTP 503. Operator alert; client should retry against another pod.
   - **Failure-mode mapping example** (`*pgTelemetryLimiter.allow`):
     ```go
     if errors.Is(err, context.DeadlineExceeded) ||
        errors.Is(err, context.Canceled) ||
        isPGLockTimeout(err) ||  // checks pgconn.PgError.Code == "55P03"
        isPGUnavailable(err) {   // checks SQLSTATE class 08 (connection_exception)
         return false, err
     }
     if errors.Is(err, sql.ErrNoRows) {  // RETURNING returned no row → denied
         return false, nil
     }
     ```
   - **PG unavailable / lock_timeout:** HTTP 503 (NOT fail-open to a per-pod limiter, which would re-introduce the bug under flaky PG). Telemetry ingest is non-critical and PG is already a hard dep for cluster mode.
   - **Sweeper:** `sharedReg.sweep` (already runs every 30s in v9 for `commander_daemons` and `commander_forward_nonces`) extends to `DELETE FROM commander_telemetry_buckets WHERE updated_at < now() - interval '1 hour'`. A bucket idle for an hour has refilled to `burst` and is functionally identical to a fresh row; deleting reclaims space.
   - **Hot key contention:** under sustained high QPS for a single key, the `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` causes row-level lock contention. **v15 fix (codex MAJOR #3):** v14 said "set `lock_timeout` on the connection"; with the existing `*sql.DB` pool that's unsafe — session settings can leak to unrelated queries when the conn is returned to the pool. v15 wraps the UPSERT in an explicit transaction:
     ```go
     func (l *pgTelemetryLimiter) allow(ctx context.Context, key telemetryKey, now time.Time) (bool, error) {
         tx, err := l.db.BeginTx(ctx, nil)
         if err != nil { return false, err }
         defer tx.Rollback()
         if _, err := tx.ExecContext(ctx, `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '100ms'`); err != nil {
             return false, err
         }
         var tokens float64
         err = tx.QueryRowContext(ctx, upsertSQL, key.WorkspaceID, key.AgentID, key.TelemetryKeyID, l.burst, l.perMinute, now).Scan(&tokens)
         switch {
         case errors.Is(err, sql.ErrNoRows):
             return false, tx.Commit()  // commit (no-op rollback prevents) + denied
         case err != nil:
             return false, err
         }
         return true, tx.Commit()
     }
     ```
     `SET LOCAL` is scoped to the transaction; `lock_timeout = '100ms'` surfaces as `pgconn.PgError{Code: "55P03"}` when triggered, which `isPGLockTimeout(err)` checks via `errors.As`.

   **Wiring change:** `observerweb.Handler.telemetryLimiter` becomes an interface `telemetryAllower` with `allow(ctx context.Context, key telemetryKey, now time.Time) (bool, error)` where `telemetryKey = struct{ WorkspaceID, AgentID, TelemetryKeyID string }`. Both `*telemetryLimiter` (in-memory) and `*pgTelemetryLimiter` implement it. In-memory variant ignores ctx and always returns `(_, nil)`. The call site at `server.go:203-207` adapts:
   ```go
   allowed, err := h.telemetryLimiter.allow(r.Context(), telemetryKey{...}, time.Now())
   switch {
   case err != nil:
       http.Error(w, "telemetry rate limit unavailable", http.StatusServiceUnavailable)
       log.Printf("observerweb: telemetry rate limit error: %v", err)
       return
   case !allowed:
       http.Error(w, "telemetry rate limit exceeded", http.StatusTooManyRequests)
       return
   }
   ```
   `cmd/observer-server/main.go` selects based on `cluster.enabled` (see §"Telemetry limiter wiring gate" below for v14 selection rules — must NOT use the old `cluster.enabled && store.driver=postgres` gate, since single-pod-with-postgres deployments should keep the in-memory limiter to avoid extra PG hits for no benefit).

All eight layers are **fail-closed on partial config**: any mix-up of `cluster.advertise_url{,_env}` set + `cluster.secret_env` empty (or vice versa) is a fatal `validateConfig` error at observer startup, NOT a silent fallback to single-pod mode. The default `cluster.internal_listen_addr=":8091"` is **applied only when `cluster.enabled=true` resolves true**, so it cannot trigger the partial-config error on legitimate single-pod deployments.

- **Binary `validateConfig`** rule (v11): `cluster.enabled AND store.driver != "postgres"` → fatal. The binary cannot see `replicaCount` (that's a chart concern); see Helm rule below.
- **Chart `templates/validate.yaml`** rules (v11): `replicaCount > 1 AND store.driver != "postgres"` → fail; `replicaCount > 1 AND !cluster.enabled` → fail. Two rules cover the (replicaCount, driver, cluster.enabled) combinations the operator can misconfigure.

Also fix the §"Component map" identity row reference if you read this in implementation: the binary's `validateConfig` rejects partial cluster/postgres configs; `replicaCount` rules live exclusively in `templates/validate.yaml`.

Default in `values.yaml` is `"auto"`. ConfigMap render: only emits `revocation_channel: "<value>"` when the operator-chosen value differs from `auto` (auto means "let the binary decide"). The pointer-nullable trick fails for Helm representation because Helm has no clean way to convey "explicit nil" in YAML; an enum is the canonical Helm pattern. |

After BOTH YAML files are decoded into `cfg`, post-merge defaulting checks `cfg.Identity.Agentserver.FreshTTL == nil` to decide whether to default; nil → assign 30s if cluster enabled else 180s.

### Postgres schema

Added to `internal/commanderhub/authstore/schema_postgres.sql`. Same migration script and same gating as the existing commander tables (`cmd/observer-server/main.go:264-268`), so existing single-pod Postgres deployments pay the DDL cost once at upgrade and otherwise see no behavior change.

**Key change (codex BLOCKER #6):** v3 PK was `(user_id, workspace_id, daemon_id)` where `daemon_id` is the per-connection random ID at `hub.go:80::newDaemonID()`. Every reconnect generated a new `daemon_id`, so the UPSERT never conflicted with the old row — the registry would accumulate stale entries instead of being updated in place. v4 keys by **stable `short_id`** (the agentserver-assigned, persisted agent identity at `commander/protocol.go:43`). The per-connection `daemon_id` moves to a separate column for routing within a pod. UI URLs use `short_id` (renamed `DaemonInfo.DaemonID` to surface short_id; bookmarks survive reconnects).

`short_id` is OPTIONAL in `RegisterPayload` today (`omitempty`). v4 makes it MANDATORY when cluster mode is active: a daemon connecting without a short_id receives a close-with-error envelope and the WS is rejected, with a clear log line. Single-pod mode keeps the optional behavior. The agentserver provisioning flow already sets short_id for all real daemons; this only catches misconfigured test/dev clients.

```

`commander_forward_nonces` lets the cluster reject replays across pods: pod A's accepted nonce blocks pod B from accepting the same nonce within the 60 s window. Sweeper trims rows older than 120 s (2× the window). For a small fleet this table grows to maybe 10k rows steady-state.

**Stable identity migration concern:** Existing single-pod Postgres deployments running v3 code do NOT have `commander_daemons` populated (the table didn't exist; this is the first table introduction). So there's no rename-existing-data migration needed. The schema_postgres.sql is idempotent (`CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`) and the column set is the v4 set from the start. **However:** if a v3 spec implementation has already been deployed (it hasn't — this is the first release), the column rename `daemon_id → short_id` + new `connection_id` column would require a real migration. We will land v4 directly without a v3 deployment window.

**`DaemonInfo.DaemonID` semantics change.** Today `DaemonInfo.DaemonID` (`registry.go:24`) carries the per-connection random id; UI URLs use it. v4: `DaemonInfo.DaemonID` exposes `short_id` instead. Effects:
- UI URLs of the form `/api/commander/daemons/<id>/...` now use stable short_id; bookmarks survive daemon reconnect (improvement).
- API consumers downstream of `/api/commander/daemons` that cached the previous random id break on this rollout. Migration note in `deploy/README.md`: clients should treat the value as opaque and refresh after rollout.
- Internal routing within a pod still uses the connection-level random id; `localRegistry.lookup` indexes by short_id externally but stores the `*daemonConn` (which has both `shortID` and `id` fields).

Rollback path: `internal/commanderhub/authstore/schema_postgres_rollback.sql` (new) with `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS commander_telemetry_buckets; DROP TABLE IF EXISTS commander_forward_nonces; DROP TABLE IF EXISTS commander_turns; DROP TABLE IF EXISTS commander_daemons;`. Helm `--migrate-only` does not auto-down; ops run psql manually if rolling back across this PR. After rollback, UI URLs that bookmarked short_ids stop working until a re-roll-forward.

### Hub struct + wiring

`Hub` grows nilable fields; `reg` field name preserved:

```go
type Hub struct {
    resolver     identity.Resolver
    upgrader     websocket.Upgrader
    reg          *localRegistry   // same field name as today; same method surface; type renamed
    sharedReg    *sharedRegistry  // nil in single-pod / legacy mode
    forwardCli   *forwardClient   // nil iff sharedReg == nil
    turns        turnStateBackend // interface; in-memory by default, Postgres-backed in shared mode
    sessionCache *sessionListCache // nil in shared mode (cache disabled cluster-wide)
    cmdSeq       atomic.Int64
    TurnTimeout  time.Duration
}
```

`NewHub(resolver identity.Resolver) *Hub` signature unchanged (preserves all 30+ `hub.reg.*` test sites enumerated by `grep -nE '\bhub\.reg\b' internal/commanderhub/*_test.go`). `MountAll` is what plugs in the shared bits via a new internal method:

```go
func (h *Hub) attachSharedRegistry(sr *sharedRegistry, fc *forwardClient, turns turnStateBackend) {
    h.sharedReg = sr
    h.forwardCli = fc
    h.turns = turns
    h.sessionCache = nil // see §"Session cache gating"
}
```

`MountAll` v3 signature:

```go
// publicMux receives /api/daemon-link + /api/commander/*.
// internalMux receives /api/commander/_internal/forward and /api/commander/_internal/drain (nil in single-pod mode → no forwarding endpoint).
func MountAll(
    publicMux *http.ServeMux,
    internalMux *http.ServeMux,
    resolver identity.Resolver,
    agentserverURL string,
    store authstore.Store,
    cluster ClusterRuntime,
)

type ClusterRuntime struct {
    DB                 *sql.DB    // nil → shared mode off
    AdvertiseURL       string     // empty → shared mode off
    Secret             []byte     // current secret
    PrevSecret         []byte     // previous secret accepted during rotation (nil OK)
    InternalListenAddr string     // for log only; main.go is what binds
}
```

`Hub.Close(ctx context.Context) error` (new) shuts down the forward client (`forwardCli.transport.CloseIdleConnections()`), cancels any heartbeat goroutines (already tied to `dc.done`, so this is mostly a no-op except for the forward client). Called by `observerweb` server shutdown chain or by `cmd/observer-server/main.go` when both servers' `Shutdown` returns.

**Caller compat:** `internal/observerweb/server.go:111` currently calls `commanderhub.MountAll(mux, resolver, opts.AgentserverURL, opts.AuthStore)`. The signature change is breaking but only one caller exists. `internal/commanderhub/wiring_test.go:21` is the second caller (test); it gets updated. **Action item:** update both call sites; grep `MountAll\(` confirms only these two.

### Observer server lifecycle (separate listener)

`cmd/observer-server/main.go` currently builds one `http.Server` (`main.go:246`, `srv := newHTTPServer(...)`). v3:

```go
// Build options:
opts := observerWebOptions(cfg, objects)
opts.AuthStore = authStore
clusterRuntime, err := buildClusterRuntime(cfg, st.DB())  // empty if !cluster.enabled
if err != nil { log.Fatal(err) }
opts.Cluster = clusterRuntime

publicHandler, internalHandler := observerweb.NewWithResolverOptions(st, usHandler, resolver, opts)

publicSrv  := newPublicHTTPServer(cfg.ListenAddr, withHealth(publicHandler, dbPing))
var internalSrv *http.Server
if clusterRuntime.AdvertiseURL != "" {
    internalSrv = newInternalHTTPServer(cfg.Cluster.InternalListenAddr, internalHandler)
}

// errgroup: any ListenAndServe error triggers Shutdown of the others.
g, ctx := errgroup.WithContext(rootCtx)
g.Go(func() error { return runServer(ctx, publicSrv) })
if internalSrv != nil { g.Go(func() error { return runServer(ctx, internalSrv) }) }
log.Fatal(g.Wait())
```

`observerweb.NewWithResolverOptions` is updated to return `(publicHandler, internalHandler http.Handler)` where `internalHandler == nil` if cluster disabled. **Caller compat:** the two current callers (`server.go:65, 76`) are in-package convenience constructors using struct-keyed `Options{}`; they get updated to return both handlers (callers in tests already use the multi-return form trivially).

**Streaming-safe timeouts** (also fixes pre-existing pre-PR bug):

```go
func newPublicHTTPServer(addr string, h http.Handler) *http.Server {
    return &http.Server{
        Addr:              addr,
        Handler:           h,
        ReadHeaderTimeout: 5 * time.Second,
        ReadTimeout:       0,                  // SSE turn POSTs can stream
        WriteTimeout:      0,                  // 10-min turn SSE
        IdleTimeout:       120 * time.Second,
    }
}

func newInternalHTTPServer(addr string, h http.Handler) *http.Server {
    return &http.Server{
        Addr:              addr,
        Handler:           h,
        ReadHeaderTimeout: 5 * time.Second,
        ReadTimeout:       0,                  // chunked forward stream
        WriteTimeout:      0,                  // chunked forward stream
        IdleTimeout:       120 * time.Second,
    }
}
```

The old `newHTTPServer` (with 60s read/write timeouts) is retained ONLY for the unrelated `/readyz`/`/healthz` health server if used elsewhere — verify there are no other callers via `grep -nE '\bnewHTTPServer\b' cmd/observer-server`. If it's only used for the listening server, remove it. Per-turn ctx still bounds runaway streams: `Hub.TurnTimeout = 10m` (`hub.go:50`) — no change.

### Registry split

Existing `*registry` → `*localRegistry`, same methods, same behavior. `Hub.reg`'s **method surface stays identical**; only the underlying type is renamed. Tests calling `hub.reg.add(...)` / `hub.reg.daemons(...)` recompile unchanged.

**`localRegistry` v5/v6 changes** (codex round-3 BLOCKER #1, refined in round-4): keyed externally by `short_id` for cluster compatibility, but its `remove` must compare-and-delete by the **exact `*daemonConn` pointer** (or equivalently by `connection_id`), not just by `(owner, short_id)`. Otherwise: same-pod fast reconnect — new WS lands on same pod, gets a new `connection_id`, registers under same `short_id`; old WS goroutine's `defer h.reg.remove(o, dc.shortID)` would delete the NEW entry.

**Field naming (codex round-4 correction):** `daemonConn` (`registry.go:39-57`) already has `id string` populated by `newDaemonID()` (`hub.go:80, 305`). v6 reuses this field as the connection generation — the spec column is named `connection_id` in SQL but mapped from `dc.id` in Go (no new field added). Wherever the spec says "connection_id", reads write `dc.id` in code.

**Entropy/error handling (codex round-5 MAJOR #2):** today's `newDaemonID()` reads 8 random bytes (64 bits) and ignores `rand.Read` errors (`hub.go:305-309`). Now that `dc.id` is cluster-wide ownership state, v7 changes the signature:

```go
// 16 bytes (128 bits) — eliminates birthday collision risk across fleet.
// Returns error so WS admission can refuse on entropy starvation.
func newDaemonID() (string, error) {
    var b [16]byte
    if _, err := rand.Read(b[:]); err != nil {
        return "", fmt.Errorf("newDaemonID: %w", err)
    }
    return hex.EncodeToString(b[:]), nil
}
```

Caller (`hub.go::ServeHTTP`): on error, write `errorEnvelope("", commander.ErrCodeBackendUnavailable, "id generation failed")` and close. crypto/rand failure is operating-system-level and unrecoverable; refusing the WS is correct.

```go
// v5 method surface (preserves existing tests that use add/daemons/lookup;
// remove gains a connection_id guard).
func (r *localRegistry) add(dc *daemonConn)                          // unchanged
func (r *localRegistry) lookup(o owner, shortID string) (*daemonConn, bool)  // key change: shortID
func (r *localRegistry) removeIf(o owner, shortID, connectionID string)      // NEW: only delete if connection_id matches
func (r *localRegistry) daemons(o owner) []DaemonInfo                // unchanged
```

Existing test sites use `hub.reg.add(&daemonConn{id: "a1", ...})` (e.g. `hub_test.go:197`). `daemonConn` gains a `shortID` field already set; tests must populate it (one-line per call site; ~10 test fixture updates). `hub.reg.remove(o, id)` calls in tests are very rare — verified via grep — and become `hub.reg.removeIf(o, shortID, connID)`. Per-test fixtures may use sentinel `connID="test-conn"`.

`*sharedRegistry`:

```go
type sharedRegistry struct {
    db                  *sql.DB
    advertiseURL        string
    heartbeatEvery      time.Duration // 15s
    onlineTTL           time.Duration // 45s
    deleteAfter         time.Duration // 5min
    sweepEvery          time.Duration // 30s
}

// connectUpsert claims ownership on a new WS connect. INSERT … ON CONFLICT
// (user_id,workspace_id,short_id) DO UPDATE without ownership guard — connect
// is allowed to take ownership because the daemon reconnected to us. Sets
// owning_instance_url AND connection_id to this WS's values. After this runs,
// the previous owning pod's heartbeat will see 0 rows (its ownership guard
// includes connection_id) and exit.
func (s *sharedRegistry) connectUpsert(ctx context.Context, dc *daemonConn) error

// heartbeatUpsert refreshes last_seen_at ONLY when this pod AND this exact
// connection still owns the row:
//   INSERT INTO commander_daemons (...) VALUES (...)
//   ON CONFLICT (user_id, workspace_id, short_id) DO UPDATE
//     SET last_seen_at = now(), display_name = EXCLUDED.display_name, …
//     WHERE commander_daemons.owning_instance_url = EXCLUDED.owning_instance_url
//       AND commander_daemons.connection_id     = EXCLUDED.connection_id;
// 0 rows affected ⇒ row was claimed by another pod OR a newer connection on
// THIS pod. In either case, the heartbeat goroutine exits and the caller
// (ServeHTTP defer chain) should also CLOSE the WS — see the heartbeat-loss
// handling note below.
func (s *sharedRegistry) heartbeatUpsert(ctx context.Context, dc *daemonConn) (stillOwn bool, err error)

// remove DELETEs only when BOTH owning_instance_url AND connection_id match
// (so a same-pod-reconnect's old WS goroutine's deferred remove doesn't
// delete the NEW connection's row):
//   DELETE FROM commander_daemons
//   WHERE user_id=$1 AND workspace_id=$2 AND short_id=$3
//     AND owning_instance_url=$4 AND connection_id=$5
func (s *sharedRegistry) remove(ctx context.Context, o owner, shortID, connectionID string) error

// lookupRemote returns peerURL+info iff a fresh row exists AND its
// owning_instance_url != this pod's advertiseURL. Returns ok=false otherwise.
func (s *sharedRegistry) lookupRemote(ctx context.Context, o owner, daemonID string) (peerURL string, info DaemonInfo, ok bool, err error)

// listAll returns every fresh row for owner. Used by /daemons, /tree, /sessions.
func (s *sharedRegistry) listAll(ctx context.Context, o owner) ([]DaemonInfo, error)

// sweep deletes rows older than deleteAfter (5min). NOT the 45s online-threshold.
// Sized so that a transient PG outage on the owning pod cannot let a peer's
// sweep delete the row.
func (s *sharedRegistry) sweep(ctx context.Context) error

// sweepNonces deletes commander_forward_nonces older than 120s.
func (s *sharedRegistry) sweepNonces(ctx context.Context) error
```

Online-for-reads (`last_seen_at > now() - 45s`) and deletable-by-sweep (`last_seen_at < now() - 5min`) are deliberately separated: a 60s PG hiccup on pod A makes pod A's daemons briefly invisible (within bound) but they are never deleted. When PG recovers, the next heartbeat's UPSERT-with-ownership-guard sees 0 affected rows because the row still exists with the same owning_instance_url — wait, that's a bug: 0 affected rows would mean "another pod took ownership," which is wrong. **The SQL above must be re-read carefully**: the `WHERE` clause runs only when there's a conflict; the row's `owning_instance_url` is compared against `EXCLUDED.owning_instance_url` which is the new (= same pod) value, so the condition `commander_daemons.owning_instance_url = EXCLUDED.owning_instance_url` holds whenever this pod hasn't been displaced. Affected rows = 1 in the normal case; 0 only when another pod has claimed it. Correct.

**Daemon admission + teardown ordering (codex MAJOR #12 fix — shared-mode admission gates on PG write):**

```go
// In ServeHTTP, after register handshake (rp now holds RegisterPayload):
o := owner{userID: ident.UserID, workspaceID: ident.WorkspaceID}

// SHARED MODE: stable short_id is REQUIRED.
if h.sharedReg != nil && strings.TrimSpace(rp.ShortID) == "" {
    _ = dc.writeEnvelope(errorEnvelope("", commander.ErrCodeInvalidRequest,
        "short_id is required when observer is in cluster mode"))
    conn.Close()
    return
}

// SHARED MODE admission: write DB row first; if it fails, refuse the WS.
// Rationale: a locally-admitted WS that can't be discovered by peers is
// worse than a refused reconnect — it creates a split brain. Daemon
// wsclient will retry within seconds.
if h.sharedReg != nil {
    upsertCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(r.Context(), 3*time.Second)
    err := h.sharedReg.connectUpsert(upsertCtx, dc)
    cancel()
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("commanderhub: shared registry upsert failed (refusing WS to avoid split-brain): %v", err)
        _ = dc.writeEnvelope(errorEnvelope("", commander.ErrCodeBackendUnavailable, "observer registry unavailable"))
        conn.Close()
        return
    }
}

// Only after the shared-registry row is durable do we admit locally.
h.reg.add(dc)

hbCtx, hbCancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
hbDone := make(chan struct{})
if h.sharedReg != nil {
    go func() {
        defer close(hbDone)
        h.sharedReg.runHeartbeat(hbCtx, dc) // ticks until ctx done OR ownership lost
    }()
}

defer h.reg.removeIf(o, dc.shortID, dc.id)   // compare-and-delete by connection_id
defer h.invalidateDaemonSessions(o, dc.shortID)
defer close(dc.done)
defer dc.failAllPending()
defer func() {
    if h.sharedReg != nil {
        hbCancel()
        <-hbDone                                       // wait for heartbeat goroutine
        removeCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.Background(), 5*time.Second)
        _ = h.sharedReg.remove(removeCtx, o, dc.shortID, dc.id) // ownership + connection guard
        cancel()
    }
}()
```

`hbCancel + <-hbDone` ensures the heartbeat goroutine has exited before the DELETE runs, so the heartbeat cannot resurrect the row between the DELETE and the WS goroutine return. The connect-upsert-before-local-admit order means **a PG-degraded pod refuses new WS connections** (daemons retry, hopefully landing on a healthy pod) rather than admitting locally-visible-but-cluster-invisible daemons.

**Heartbeat-loss handling** (codex round-3 BLOCKER #1 addendum + round-4 explicit race window): when `heartbeatUpsert` returns `stillOwn=false`, the heartbeat goroutine logs WARN and **forcibly closes the WS** via `dc.conn.Close()`. This wakes the read loop with `io.EOF`, ServeHTTP exits, defers run with `removeIf`+`remove` — both guarded by `connection_id`, so neither deletes the new owner's state. Daemon's `wsclient.Run()` reconnects via its normal backoff (`commander/wsclient.go:88`).

**Race-window elimination via per-send ownership check** (codex round-5/6/7): in shared mode, every local-path `SendCommand[Stream]` does a fresh ownership read against `commander_daemons` before writing to the WS. **No positive cache.** Only a negative cache: once we discover we've lost ownership, we cache that for the brief remaining lifetime of the `*daemonConn` to avoid re-querying for the next command on the same dead conn.

```go
// In SendCommand[Stream], before dc.writeEnvelope:
if h.sharedReg != nil {
    if !dc.confirmOwnership(ctx) {
        return nil, ErrDaemonGone
    }
}

// daemonConn gains:
type daemonConn struct {
    /* ... existing ... */
    ownershipLost    atomic.Bool // sticky: once true, never goes back to false
}

// confirmOwnership: read the row's owning_instance_url + connection_id; if
// they don't match this pod + this conn, mark ownership lost and return
// false. PG failure or row missing → false too (fail-closed). Bounded
// latency via per-call context: 500ms.
func (dc *daemonConn) confirmOwnership(parentCtx context.Context) bool {
    if dc.ownershipLost.Load() {
        return false
    }
    ctx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(parentCtx, 500*time.Millisecond)
    defer cancel()
    var ownerURL, connID string
    row := dc.hub.sharedReg.db.QueryRowContext(ctx,
        `SELECT owning_instance_url, connection_id FROM commander_daemons
         WHERE user_id=$1 AND workspace_id=$2 AND short_id=$3`,
        dc.owner.userID, dc.owner.workspaceID, dc.shortID)
    err := row.Scan(&ownerURL, &connID)
    if err != nil || ownerURL != dc.hub.sharedReg.advertiseURL || connID != dc.id {
        dc.ownershipLost.Store(true)
        return false
    }
    return true
}
```

**Cost analysis:** every `SendCommand[Stream]` adds one PG SELECT (single-row by PK, sub-ms typical). For an active 1k-daemon fleet at 10 commands/sec aggregate, that's 10 extra PG queries/sec — negligible. The single-pod path (no shared mode) is unaffected. Long-running streams pay the check ONCE at SendCommandStream start; per-frame routing inside the daemon→observer WS doesn't recheck.

**Residual race window: zero.** A sibling pod's `connectUpsert` updates the row atomically; the losing pod's next `confirmOwnership` reads the new row and refuses. The 10s/10m hang on stale writes is fully eliminated.

**PG outage degradation:** if PG is unreachable during `confirmOwnership`, commands return `ErrDaemonGone` → 502 to UI. This is a deliberate fail-closed choice — a brief PG hiccup degrades commander to read-mostly. Acceptable; matches how the heartbeat path handles PG outage. NetworkPolicy + nonce-DoS prevention in the forwarding path keep us safe even under degraded PG.

**Why not PG LISTEN/NOTIFY:** would require a per-pod long-lived LISTEN connection and an additional pgx feature. The cached-check approach achieves the same SLA (≤5s) with simpler code and no extra connection. LISTEN/NOTIFY is a viable follow-up if the SELECT-on-stale-cache becomes a hot path.

### Forwarding: client, server, codec

#### Internal mux — separate `http.ServeMux`

The forward endpoint is mounted on a **second mux** that is **never** registered on the public ServeMux. The chart exposes the internal mux via a per-pod-addressable Service (see §"Internal Service"), not via Ingress. The public Ingress/HTTPRoute templates also add a hardening rule (§"Ingress hardening") so even if a future change accidentally re-mounts `/api/commander/_internal/forward` on the public mux, the edge will 404 it.

**Route table** (for clarity):

| Mux       | Path prefix                          | Purpose                                   | Auth                                         |
|-----------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| public    | `/api/daemon-link`                   | daemon WS upgrade                         | Bearer token via identity.Resolver           |
| public    | `/api/commander/login*`              | commander UI login flow                   | (login flow itself)                          |
| public    | `/api/commander/{daemons,tree,sessions}` | UI read endpoints                       | cookie session via Authenticator             |
| public    | `/api/commander/daemons/{id}/...`    | UI command/turn endpoints                 | cookie session via Authenticator             |
| public    | `/commander`, `/commander/assets/*`  | UI page + assets                          | (public)                                     |
| public    | `/api/commander/_internal/*`         | **REJECTED at Ingress (deny rule)**       | n/a — never reach the pod from outside       |
| internal  | `/api/commander/_internal/forward`   | pod-to-pod command/stream forwarding      | HMAC + nonce; NetworkPolicy peers-only       |
| internal  | `/api/commander/_internal/drain`     | preStop drain hook                        | loopback OR HMAC; NetworkPolicy peers-only   |

#### Per-pod DNS — headless Service

A standard `ClusterIP` Service load-balances across pods, which would defeat forwarding (a forward request from pod B would round-trip back to pod B sometimes). The chart adds a **headless Service** (`clusterIP: None, publishNotReadyAddresses: true`) so DNS resolves per-pod. The advertised URL stays `http://$(POD_IP):8091` — pod-IP is what each pod sees about itself via the downward API, and the headless Service makes those IPs DNS-discoverable for any non-routing observability needs. Forwarding itself dials the IP directly; it does not depend on DNS.

**Loop prevention:** if `peer URL == advertiseURL` (misconfiguration / single-pod-but-cluster-enabled), forward client refuses with `ErrDaemonNotFound` and logs ERROR. Same applies if peer URL equals `127.0.0.1` / `localhost` against an `advertiseURL` of the form `http://10.x:port`.

#### Auth — HMAC + nonce

The forward request carries three headers:

```
X-Observer-Cluster-Timestamp: <unix-seconds-decimal>
X-Observer-Cluster-Nonce:     <32 random hex chars>
X-Observer-Cluster-Auth:      <hex(hmac_sha256(secret, timestamp || "\n" || nonce || "\n" || body))>
```

Receiver (strict ordering — DO NOT reorder; nonce insert MUST come last so an unauthenticated caller cannot exhaust the nonce table or DoS legitimate senders):
1. Reject (413) immediately if `Content-Length > 1.5 MiB` (wire cap, see "Wire sizing" below).
2. Reject (400) if any of the three headers absent or malformed (e.g. `X-Observer-Cluster-Auth` not 64 hex chars; timestamp not decimal int; nonce not 32 hex chars).
3. Reject (403) if `|now - timestamp| > 60s` — header-only check, no body read yet.
4. Read body into a `[]byte` via `io.LimitReader(r.Body, 1.5 MiB+1)`; reject 413 if N+1 bytes were read (body exceeds cap).
5. Decode the hex auth header into a fixed `[32]byte`. Compute the expected HMAC over `ts || "\n" || nonce || "\n" || body` with `Secret` into another fixed `[32]byte`; compare with `hmac.Equal` (which calls `subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` on equal-length inputs — safe). If mismatch AND `PrevSecret != nil`, recompute with `PrevSecret` and compare. Reject 403 on mismatch with both.
6. Now (and ONLY now) `INSERT INTO commander_forward_nonces (nonce, received_at) VALUES ($1, now()) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. If `rows affected = 0` (conflict), reject 403 ("replay"). If the INSERT itself returns an error (PG unavailable), reject **503 fail-closed** — never accept without successful nonce insert. This guarantees a leaked secret cannot let an attacker replay within the 60 s window even if PG is degraded.
7. Append to structured audit log (WARN if denied, INFO if accepted): `{"event":"forward.received","outcome":"accepted|denied_<reason>","peer":"<remote-addr>","ts":<ts>,"user_id":"<from body>","workspace_id":"<from body>","daemon_id":"<from body>","command":"<from body>"}`. Never log the auth header, the nonce material, the secret, or the body. Audit log goes to stderr (operator-visible).
8. Verify `daemon_id` is present in this pod's local registry (`localReg.lookup` only — never bounce back through `sharedReg.lookupRemote` here; that would allow infinite peer loops). 404 if not present.

Sender:
- Computes HMAC with `Secret` (current). On 403 response AND `PrevSecret != nil` (sender is mid-rotation), retry ONCE with `PrevSecret` (in case the receiver hasn't picked up the new secret yet). This handles the asymmetric-rollout case codex flagged: a new pod sending with Secret=NEW to an old pod that still has Secret=OLD/PrevSecret=nil will 403 on first try and 200 on the PrevSecret retry. No second retry: limits damage if the secret really is wrong.
- Sender uses a fresh random `nonce` per call (32 random hex chars; `crypto/rand`).
- Sender's audit log entry: `{"event":"forward.sent","outcome":"<accepted|retried_prev|failed>","peer":"<url>","daemon_id":"<id>","command":"<name>"}`.

#### Three-phase secret rotation (also documented in `deploy/README.md`)

Codex flagged that two-phase rotation (just bumping current/prev in one rollout) breaks mid-rollout when a new pod sends NEW to an old pod that knows only OLD. The 403→PrevSecret retry above handles the case where the SENDER has PrevSecret set but the receiver doesn't. The full safe-rotation procedure:

- **Phase A** ("acceptance"): ops sets `cluster-secret = OLD, cluster-secret-prev = OLD` on the Secret (duplicate values). Rollout. All pods accept OLD; sender uses OLD. No-op functionally; sets up the infrastructure for phase B.
- **Phase B** ("introduce new"): ops sets `cluster-secret = NEW, cluster-secret-prev = OLD`. Rollout. New pods sign with NEW; old pods (mid-rollout) accept NEW because they're already in phase A (have prev = OLD, recompute with prev on mismatch). New pods accept OLD via prev field. **Both directions work** during the rolling window.
- **Phase C** ("retire old"): ops sets `cluster-secret = NEW, cluster-secret-prev = ""` (or omits). Rollout. All pods sign+accept NEW only.

The 403→prev-retry is a defense-in-depth for misordered rollouts within a phase. Tested by `forward_test.go::TestSecretRotationThreePhase`.

#### Request shape

```
POST /api/commander/_internal/forward HTTP/1.1   (mounted on the INTERNAL listener only — NOT on the public mux)
Headers: as above
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: <N>      # capped at 1.5 MiB (request body) / 1 MiB (per streamed envelope); receiver returns 413 if exceeded

{
  "user_id":      "<owner.userID>",
  "workspace_id": "<owner.workspaceID>",
  "daemon_id":    "<daemon-id>",
  "command":      "session_turn" | "list_sessions" | "get_session" | "list_files" | "read_file",
  "args":         {...},
  "streaming":    true | false,
  "timeout_ms":   600000        // bounded by receiver to Hub.TurnTimeout
}
```

#### Response — non-streaming

```
200 OK + Content-Type: application/json + {"result": <raw command_result payload>}
```
or
```
200 OK + {"error": {"code": "<commander.ErrCode*>", "message": "..."}}
```

The forward **client** maps `{"error":...}` back to `*DaemonError` (preserving `commander.ErrCodeSessionNotFound`, `ErrCodeInvalidRequest`, etc.) so `http.go::writeSendCmdError` (`http.go:190-207`) continues to map daemon-originated errors to the correct HTTP status (404 for session_not_found, 400 for invalid_request, etc.). **Test coverage:** `forward_test.go::TestForwardErrorCodeRoundTrip`.

#### Response — streaming

`Transfer-Encoding: chunked`. Body is a sequence of `<decimal-ascii-length>\n<envelope-json-bytes>`. Receiver reads ASCII digits until `\n` (max 7 digits — `1048576` is 7 chars; cap `length ≤ 1 MiB`), then reads exactly that many bytes. Each chunk MUST parse as a single `commander.Envelope`. Stream ends on EOF (terminal frame seen) or upstream cancel (see §"Cancellation propagation").

#### Wire sizing — worst-case math (codex round-3 BLOCKER #2 correction)

Round-2 spec proposed 4 MiB cap reasoning that text files "don't escape every byte." Codex correctly objected: a 2 MiB file full of valid non-NUL **C0 control bytes** (`\x01`-`\x1F`, all valid UTF-8) passes `utf8.Valid` and isn't classified as binary by typical heuristics, then `encoding/json` escapes each byte as `\u00XX` (6 bytes), producing ~12 MiB.

The correct approach: **bound JSON-encoded size at the daemon, not raw byte size**. The wire never sees > 1 MiB even pathologically, matching the existing observer `wsReadLimit = 1 << 20`.

Changes in v5 (note: these affect the daemon side, which is a separate binary):

- `internal/commander/files.go::Handler.ReadFile` (caller-side, pre-JSON-encode): after constructing the result struct, run `out, _ := json.Marshal(result)`; if `len(out) > maxEncodedFileResponse` (set to 768 KiB to leave headroom for envelope wrapping), set `Result.TooLarge = true, Content = ""` and return the small placeholder. This guarantees a `read_file` `command_result` envelope is always < `wsReadLimit`.
- This is a **daemon-side change** in package `internal/commander`. **Both `cmd/driver-agent` and `cmd/slave-agent` import this package** (`cmd/driver-agent/main.go:349`, `cmd/slave-agent/main.go:441`), so a coordinated rollout is required (codex round-4 MAJOR #3):
  - Observer image: built and pushed by the existing `observer-deploy.yml` workflow.
  - driver-agent + slave-agent binaries: built and pushed by the separate release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`). v6 adds a release coordination note in `deploy/README.md`: bump observer and daemon binaries together for this PR.
  - **Mixed-version safety:** old daemons (no encoded-size check) sending to new observers risk hitting the existing `wsReadLimit = 1 MiB` and getting a WS close — pre-existing failure mode, no regression. New daemons connecting to old observers: smaller previews returned for control-heavy files — UX improvement; no breakage.
  - **Capability gate (codex round-5/6 MAJOR #3 — ENFORCED with correct status code):** the daemon's `RegisterPayload.Capabilities` set gains a new entry `"file_preview_encoded_cap"` when the daemon enforces the encoded-size check. In shared mode, the observer's `read_file` handler (`http.go::ReadFile` via `proxy.go::ReadFile`) returns a dedicated `*DaemonError{Code: commander.ErrCodeDaemonUpgradeRequired, Message: "daemon binary too old; upgrade required for file preview in cluster mode"}` for daemons missing this capability. The new error code is added to `commander/protocol.go`'s ErrCode const block and mapped by `http.go::writeSendCmdError` to **HTTP 426 Upgrade Required** (semantically correct; client can show an actionable upgrade prompt). `ErrCodeBackendUnavailable` (= 502) would have been misleading since the daemon IS reachable, just incompatible.
  - In single-pod mode (legacy), no enforcement — the 1 MiB WS read limit already kills oversized frames the way it always has; no behavior change.
  - **Mixed-version rollout window:** during the ~30-120 s rolling-update window, some daemons may not yet have the capability — they get 400 on read_file but other commands work. This is the same risk profile as the registry mixed-version window; documented in `deploy/README.md` along with the rollout coordination notes.

**Wire caps v5 (unchanged from existing single-pod behavior):**
- Observer `wsReadLimit` stays `1 << 20` (1 MiB). NO raise. v4's raise to 4 MiB is REVERTED.
- Forward request body cap: `1.5 << 20` (1.5 MiB) — accommodates one 1 MiB envelope plus the forward request's JSON wrapping (`{user_id, workspace_id, ..., args: <1 MiB payload>}`).
- Forward streamed envelope cap (per length-prefixed chunk): `1 << 20` (1 MiB) — same as WS read limit; envelopes pass through transparently.

Per-envelope wire format constants live in `internal/commanderhub/forward_codec.go`:
```go
const (
    forwardReqBodyCap    = 1 << 20 + 1 << 19  // 1.5 MiB
    forwardStreamFrameCap = 1 << 20            // 1 MiB
)
```

The `Content-Length > forwardReqBodyCap` and `length-prefix > forwardStreamFrameCap` checks return 413 (request) or terminate stream + log (response). Tests `forward_test.go::TestForwardBodyCapEnforced` and `TestForwardStreamFrameCapEnforced` cover both.

#### Back-pressure

The forwarding server's drain goroutine wraps the local channel in a **closeable wrapper channel** with buffer 256:

```go
// sendCommandStreamToLocal is the factored-out post-lookup body of
// SendCommandStream. It does NOT depend on hub.reg.lookup — caller has
// the *daemonConn already.
//
// outBuffer chooses the wrapper-channel size; 16 for direct browser SSE
// (existing default), 256 for forwarding receivers (larger pod-to-pod buffer).
func (h *Hub) sendCommandStreamToLocal(ctx context.Context, dc *daemonConn, command string, args json.RawMessage, outBuffer int) (<-chan commander.Envelope, error)
```

The forwarding receiver's drain calls `sendCommandStreamToLocal(ctx, dc, command, args, 256)`. The `out` channel IS closed by `sendCommandStreamToLocal`'s wrapper goroutine on terminal/cancel/disconnect (matching today's `proxy.go:103: defer close(out)`), so the drain loop's `case env, ok := <-out` reliably fires `ok=false` to exit. **`pendingEntry.ch` is still never closed** — the wrapper channel is the only thing closed, identical to today's pattern.

**Drop telemetry:** the forwarding receiver's drain goroutine counts each time it had to drop a non-terminal envelope (when the HTTP body writer was blocked AND the wrapper buffer was full). Counts surface as a structured log line at WARN, rate-limited to once per (daemon_id, command) per second, with format `{"event":"forward.dropped","daemon_id":...,"command":...,"count":N}`. After the first drop in a stream, a synthetic `{type:"event",payload:{event_kind:"truncated",text:"observer-side buffer overflow"}}` envelope is sent at the next opportunity so the UI shows a visible gap.

#### Cancellation propagation

1. Browser closes SSE → Pod B's `ch.turn` `r.Context().Done()` fires.
2. Pod B's forward client cancels its outbound `http.Request` ctx → Go's transport closes the underlying TCP connection.
3. Pod A's forward server: a watcher goroutine selects on `r.Context().Done()` (Go's net/http fires this on TCP close) and cancels the inner ctx passed to `sendCommandStreamToLocal`.
4. `sendCommandStreamToLocal`'s wrapper goroutine selects on `<-ctx.Done()`, calls `dc.removePending(cmdID)` (frees the daemon-side slot, unblocks `routeFrame`'s terminal sends via the per-entry cancel), and closes `out`.
5. Forwarding server's drain loop reads `ok=false` from `out`, exits.

Test: `forward_test.go::TestForwardCallerCancelPropagates` opens a stream that emits one envelope every 50ms, cancels caller ctx at 200ms, asserts `removePending` runs within 1s by mocking the daemon side.

### Forward-aware command path (proxy.go)

`SendCommand` and `SendCommandStream` are restructured:

```go
func (h *Hub) SendCommand(ctx context.Context, o owner, daemonID, command string, args json.RawMessage) (json.RawMessage, error) {
    if dc, ok := h.reg.lookup(o, daemonID); ok {
        return h.sendCommandToLocal(ctx, dc, command, args)
    }
    if h.sharedReg == nil {
        return nil, ErrDaemonNotFound
    }
    peerURL, _, ok, err := h.sharedReg.lookupRemote(ctx, o, daemonID)
    if err != nil { return nil, err }
    if !ok { return nil, ErrDaemonNotFound }
    return h.forwardCli.send(ctx, peerURL, forwardRequest{
        Owner: o, DaemonID: daemonID, Command: command, Args: args, Streaming: false,
    })
}
```

`SendCommandStream` is analogous, but the forward path returns a `<-chan commander.Envelope` fed by the forward client's decoder goroutine. **`FanOutSessions`** (`proxy.go:156`) is updated to call `h.listDaemons(ctx, o)` (which consults shared registry) instead of `h.reg.daemons(o)`, so it asks every online daemon across all pods.

### Read-path helpers

```go
// listDaemons consults shared registry if attached, else local map.
// Used by ch.daemons, CommanderTree, FanOutSessions.
func (h *Hub) listDaemons(ctx context.Context, o owner) ([]DaemonInfo, error)

// lookupDaemon mirrors SendCommand's lookup logic; used by ch.turn's
// existence guard.
type lookupResult struct {
    Local   *daemonConn // non-nil iff owned by this pod
    PeerURL string      // non-empty iff Local == nil and a remote pod has it
    Info    DaemonInfo  // populated for both cases
}
func (h *Hub) lookupDaemon(ctx context.Context, o owner, daemonID string) (lookupResult, bool, error)
```

`ch.turn`'s existence guard (`http.go:226`) changes:

```go
res, ok, err := ch.hub.lookupDaemon(r.Context(), o, daemonID)
if err != nil {
    http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadGateway)
    return
}
if !ok {
    http.NotFound(w, r)
    return
}
// Continue regardless of res.Local vs res.PeerURL — SendCommandStream below routes correctly.
```

`CommanderTree` (`tree.go:123-138`) and `FanOutSessions` (`proxy.go:156`) call `h.listDaemons` instead of `h.reg.daemons`.

### Turn state — Postgres-backed in shared mode

`turn_state.go` extracts the existing struct into an interface and reuses it:

```go
type turnStateBackend interface {
    begin(ctx context.Context, key turnKey) (bool, error)
    set(ctx context.Context, key turnKey, state turnState) error
    finish(ctx context.Context, key turnKey, state turnState) error
    fail(ctx context.Context, key turnKey, msg string) error
    rekey(ctx context.Context, old, new turnKey) error
    get(ctx context.Context, key turnKey) (turnSnapshot, error)
    // updateFromEnvelope is the single owning-pod writer hook called from
    // routeFrame; mirrors today's http.go::updateTurnStateFromEnvelope.
    updateFromEnvelope(ctx context.Context, key turnKey, env commander.Envelope) error
    // cleanupOrphans flips any turn rows older than `older` and not in
    // terminal state to 'disconnected'. Run by the per-pod sweep goroutine
    // (every 30s); `older` defaults to Hub.TurnTimeout (10 min).
    cleanupOrphans(ctx context.Context, older time.Duration) error
}
```

All methods take a `context.Context` so PG row locks, deadlocks, or failover don't hang the WS goroutine. Callers always pass a per-operation timeout (5 s default for state mutations; the request ctx for `get`). The Postgres impl sets `SET LOCAL lock_timeout = '500ms'; SET LOCAL statement_timeout = '5s';` at the start of every transaction so a hot row never wedges the heartbeat path.

In-memory impl is the existing code, unchanged. New `turn_state_pg.go` provides `*pgTurnStore` implementing the same interface against `commander_turns`. `turnKey` is `{owner, shortID, sessionID}` (NOT the per-connection daemon_id — codex round-3 MAJOR #6 correction). `begin` uses:

```sql
INSERT INTO commander_turns (user_id, workspace_id, short_id, session_id, state, updated_at)
VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, 'queued', now())
ON CONFLICT (user_id, workspace_id, short_id, session_id) DO UPDATE
  SET state='queued', updated_at=now()
  WHERE commander_turns.state IN ('idle','done','error','awaiting_approval','disconnected')
RETURNING (xmax = 0) AS inserted
```

- 1 row returned with `inserted=true` → first turn, begin succeeded
- 1 row returned with `inserted=false` → previous turn ended (terminal state); begin succeeded
- 0 rows returned → conflict (current state is `queued` or `answering`); begin returns false

Result: cross-pod turn-in-flight dedup falls out naturally — a second pod's `begin` blocks the duplicate turn.

The **owning pod is the single writer** for non-`begin` mutations. `routeFrame` (`hub.go:243-260`) is extended:

```go
// pendingEntry gains:
type pendingEntry struct {
    ch        chan commander.Envelope
    cancel    chan struct{}
    streaming bool
    command   string   // NEW: e.g. "session_turn"; set at registerPending time
    sessionID string   // NEW: extracted from args when command == "session_turn"
}
```

After a successful `sendOrDrop` of a terminal/status frame in `routeFrame`, the owning pod calls `dc.hub.turns.updateFromEnvelope(...)` with the envelope and the recorded `(command, sessionID, owner, shortID)`. The update logic mirrors today's `updateTurnStateFromEnvelope` in `http.go:323-372` — refactored into a method on `turnStateBackend` so both paths share it.

**`turnKey` rename (codex round-4 MAJOR #5):** existing `turnKey` (`turn_state.go:22`) is `{owner, daemonID, sessionID}`. v6 renames `daemonID` field to `shortID` (semantic: the stable agent id; matches the registry PK). Every struct literal and field access updated — callers identified by `grep -rn 'turnKey{' internal/commanderhub` (10 sites in `http.go`, all in the `ch.turn` handler and its helpers). Renames are mechanical and tracked in the implementation plan.

**Unsolicited frames** (env.ID == "") are NOT correlated to a pendingEntry — they take a different path: the receiver looks at `env.Type` and, for known session-mutating types (`event` with `event_kind=session_changed`), invalidates the (now-shared-mode-disabled) session cache and updates turn-state if the payload carries a session_id. Implementation: same `updateFromEnvelope` taking a nil pendingEntry path. Today's code ignores unsolicited frames entirely (`hub.go:244-246`); this remains the default, with the new opt-in handler only firing on whitelisted event_kinds.

**Read paths** (`cachedSessionRows` at `tree.go:168`, `mergeCurrentTurnState` at `tree.go:224`) read from `turns.get(key)` — interface call, so Postgres-backed reads on every list. Acceptable: `commander_turns` reads by PK in jsonb-cache PG are sub-ms; the existing `cachedSessionRows` already does an out-of-process round-trip to the daemon.

### Session cache disabled in shared mode

`NewHub` builds `sessionCache = newSessionListCache(10*time.Second)` today (`hub.go:49`). When `attachSharedRegistry` is called, `h.sessionCache = nil` and `cachedSessionRows` skips the cache:

```go
func (h *Hub) cachedSessionRows(ctx context.Context, o owner, info DaemonInfo) ([]SessionRow, error) {
    if h.sessionCache == nil {
        return h.refreshSessionRows(ctx, o, info)
    }
    // … existing path …
}
```

The cache existed to spare daemons repeated `list_sessions` on quick UI tab refreshes. In shared mode, the per-pod cache + cross-pod invalidation cost dwarfs that benefit. A future optimization (out of scope) could move the cache to Postgres with a generation column bumped by `routeFrame` on owning pod; for now, deleting the cache is cheaper than getting cross-pod invalidation right.

`invalidateDaemonSessions` (today called from `http.go:132, 242, 248, 254, 320, 341, 344, 347, 367, 370` — yes, `http.go:132` is in fact the disconnect path's `MethodGet` check, NOT an invalidation site; the disconnect-invalidation actually lives in `hub.go:132` via `defer h.invalidateDaemonSessions(...)` — line references corrected here) becomes a no-op when `sessionCache == nil`. Callers remain as belt-and-suspenders.

### Cluster config

```yaml
cluster:
  advertise_url: ""             # bare value, OR
  advertise_url_env: ""         # env var name (typical: OBSERVER_ADVERTISE_URL)
  secret_env: ""                # env var name (typical: OBSERVER_CLUSTER_SECRET)
  prev_secret_env: ""           # env var name for previous secret (rotation; optional)
  internal_listen_addr: ""      # default ":8091" applied ONLY when cluster is enabled
```

`validateConfig` rules (fail-closed, runs in `cmd/observer-server/main.go`):
- Resolve `advertise_url` (`advertise_url_env` wins if both set), `secret_env` value, `prev_secret_env` value.
- Define "cluster enabled" = (resolved `advertise_url` non-empty) AND (resolved `secret` non-empty).
- If "cluster enabled" AND `store.driver != "postgres"` → fatal `"cluster mode requires store.driver=postgres"`.
- If exactly one of (resolved `advertise_url`, resolved `secret`) is non-empty → fatal `"cluster: advertise_url and secret_env must both be configured, or both omitted"`.
- If "cluster enabled" AND `internal_listen_addr` empty → apply default `":8091"`.
- If NOT "cluster enabled" → `internal_listen_addr` MUST be empty (catches typo where operator set the listen addr but forgot advertise/secret); fatal otherwise.
- `prev_secret_env` resolves to empty is fine (rotation not in progress).
- Log on startup: `commanderhub: shared registry enabled (advertise=<url>, internal=<addr>)` OR `commanderhub: single-pod mode (registry=local)`.

This makes "store.driver=postgres + cluster.* empty" a legitimate single-pod-Postgres deployment with no validation noise, while a partial cluster.* config aborts startup.

### Helm chart

#### `values.yaml`

```yaml
# v3: flip dev default from 2 → 1 because the chart's new fail-fast refuses
# replicaCount > 1 without cluster config. Multi-pod is opt-in.
replicaCount: 1

```

#### `values-production.example.yaml`

```yaml
replicaCount: 3
cluster:
  enabled: true
  # Ops MUST add `cluster-secret` (and optionally `cluster-secret-prev` during

                                    # also get it via templates/secret.yaml.
```

#### `templates/validate.yaml` (always-rendered, no underscore prefix)

Codex flagged: Helm treats `_*.yaml` files as partials — they're parsed but their top-level actions don't necessarily fire as standalone templates (Helm only processes them via `include`/`template`). The safe approach is a non-underscore file that emits a comment-only output:

```gotemplate
{{- $multiPod   := gt (int .Values.replicaCount) 1 -}}
{{- $isPostgres := eq .Values.config.store.driver "postgres" -}}
{{- if and $multiPod (not $isPostgres) -}}
{{- fail "replicaCount > 1 requires store.driver=postgres (sqlite is single-pod only)" -}}
{{- end -}}
{{- if and $multiPod (not .Values.cluster.enabled) -}}
{{- fail "replicaCount > 1 requires cluster.enabled=true (set cluster.enabled=true; provide secret.clusterSecret OR an existingSecret with key 'cluster-secret')" -}}
{{- end -}}
{{- if and .Values.cluster.enabled .Values.secret.create (not .Values.secret.clusterSecret) -}}
{{- fail "cluster.enabled=true with secret.create=true requires secret.clusterSecret (must be >=32 chars of high-entropy random; e.g. `openssl rand -base64 48`)" -}}
{{- end -}}
{{- if and .Values.cluster.enabled .Values.secret.create .Values.secret.clusterSecret -}}
  {{- if lt (len .Values.secret.clusterSecret) 32 -}}
  {{- fail (printf "secret.clusterSecret must be >=32 chars; got %d" (len .Values.secret.clusterSecret)) -}}
  {{- end -}}
{{- end -}}
# observer chart validation passed
```

The trailing `# observer chart validation passed` is a single comment that renders to a non-resource. Helm doesn't require this file to declare a Kubernetes resource — comment-only YAML is valid; `kubectl apply` ignores it. Verified by manual test before this PR ships.

Validation rules:
- `replicaCount > 1` + sqlite ⇒ fatal (new — codex MINOR #17).
- `replicaCount > 1` + postgres + no cluster.enabled ⇒ fatal.
- `cluster.enabled=true` + chart-managed secret without `secret.clusterSecret` ⇒ fatal.
- `cluster.enabled=true` + chart-managed secret with `secret.clusterSecret < 32 chars` ⇒ fatal (new — codex MAJOR #9).
- (No length check possible for `existingSecret` at chart-render time; the init container handles that — see below.)

#### Init container — secret validity check (length-enforced)

`templates/deployment.yaml` init container body (replacing the v3 simpler non-empty check):

```sh
LEN=$(printf '%s' "$CHECK_VAL" | wc -c)
if [ -z "$CHECK_VAL" ]; then
    echo "{{ .Values.cluster.secretEnv }}: empty" >&2
    echo "check that the Secret has key {{ default \"cluster-secret\" .Values.cluster.secretKey }}" >&2
    exit 1
fi
if [ "$LEN" -lt 32 ]; then
    echo "{{ .Values.cluster.secretEnv }}: length $LEN < 32 (must be >=32 random bytes)" >&2
    exit 1
fi
```

The init container reads the env var from whichever Secret is in play (`{{ default (include "observer.configSecretName" .) .Values.existingSecret }}`).

#### Cluster config must reach the pod even with `existingSecret`

Codex flagged: `templates/secret.yaml` is fully gated by `{{- if and .Values.secret.create (not .Values.existingSecret) }}`. Production uses `existingSecret: observer-production-secret` and `secret.create=false`, so the entire `observer.yaml` block (with all config) is never rendered into a chart-managed Secret. The operator manages the Secret externally.

The `cluster:` config is **non-secret** by design — `secret_env`/`prev_secret_env`/`advertise_url_env` are env var *names*, and `internal_listen_addr` is a port string. The actual secret VALUES live in the existingSecret's `cluster-secret`/`cluster-secret-prev` keys. So the safe move is:

1. **Cluster config block moves into `templates/configmap.yaml`'s `observer.nonsecret.yaml`** (always rendered, regardless of `secret.create`). This file mounts at `/etc/observer/nonsecret/`. The observer config loader is extended to merge `nonsecret/observer.nonsecret.yaml` on top of the main `observer.yaml` (new behavior).
2. **`observer.yaml` (in the Secret when `secret.create=true`) gains v17/v18 conditional renders for `fresh_ttl` and `revocation_channel`** — `templates/secret.yaml` lines around `fresh_ttl: …` (currently line 54) change from hard-coded `default "180s"` to conditional emission (see v17 chart-fix below). This way `secret.create=true` cluster deployments ALSO let the binary's pointer-nullable default fire when the value is `""`/`"auto"`. Operators managing observer.yaml externally simply add the `cluster:`/identity fields themselves; the chart documentation in `values-production.example.yaml` includes the exact YAML snippet to add.
3. **Init container reads OBSERVER_CLUSTER_SECRET from whichever Secret is in play** — the `secretKeyRef.name` template uses `{{ default (include "observer.configSecretName" .) .Values.existingSecret }}` (already done correctly in v3 §"Deployment template").

`templates/configmap.yaml` v4 (extends today's `observer.nonsecret.yaml` block at `configmap.yaml:11-26`):

```gotemplate
  observer.nonsecret.yaml: |
    listen_addr: {{ .Values.config.listenAddr | quote }}
    production: {{ .Values.config.production }}

`cmd/observer-server/main.go` config loader change:

```go
// loadConfig today reads ONLY the path arg. v4: also merge a sibling
// nonsecret/observer.nonsecret.yaml when present.
func loadConfig(path string) (*Config, error) {
    // ... existing YAML decode of path ...
    nonsecretPath := filepath.Join(filepath.Dir(path), "nonsecret", "observer.nonsecret.yaml")
    if data, err := os.ReadFile(nonsecretPath); err == nil {
        if err := yaml.Unmarshal(data, &cfg); err != nil {
            return nil, fmt.Errorf("observer.nonsecret.yaml: %w", err)
        }
    }
    // ... existing defaulting + validateConfig ...
}
```

`templates/secret.yaml` v17/v18 changes:

(a) Identity-cache lines (`templates/secret.yaml:54-58`) change from hard-coded defaults to conditional emission so the binary's pointer-nullable post-merge default fires when operators don't explicitly set:

```gotemplate
        {{- if .Values.config.identity.agentserver.freshTTL }}
        fresh_ttl: {{ .Values.config.identity.agentserver.freshTTL | quote }}
        {{- end }}
        {{- $rc := default "auto" .Values.config.identity.agentserver.revocationChannel -}}
        {{- if eq $rc "enabled" }}
        revocation_channel: "postgres"
        {{- else if eq $rc "disabled" }}
        revocation_channel: ""
        {{- else if and (ne $rc "auto") }}
        {{- fail (printf "config.identity.agentserver.revocationChannel must be auto|enabled|disabled; got %q" $rc) }}
        {{- end }}
```

(`stale_grace`, `request_timeout`, `cache_capacity`, `startup_probe` stay as today.)

(b) New secret data keys (still gated by `secret.create && !existingSecret`):

```gotemplate
  {{- if and .Values.cluster.enabled .Values.secret.create (not .Values.existingSecret) }}
  {{ default "cluster-secret" .Values.cluster.secretKey }}: {{ required "secret.clusterSecret is required when cluster.enabled=true and secret.create=true" .Values.secret.clusterSecret | quote }}
  {{- if .Values.secret.clusterSecretPrev }}
  {{ default "cluster-secret-prev" .Values.cluster.prevSecretKey }}: {{ .Values.secret.clusterSecretPrev | quote }}
  {{- end }}
  {{- end }}
```

For `existingSecret` deployments, ops manages the `cluster-secret` data key in the external Secret manifest. The init container at pod startup asserts the env is non-empty AND meets a 32-byte minimum (see §"Init container — secret validity check").

#### `templates/deployment.yaml`

The chart already has a conditional `initContainers:` block (lines 30-74) only when Postgres wait is enabled. v3 refactors into a single `initContainers:` block that includes either or both:

```gotemplate
{{- $needPostgresWait := and (eq .Values.config.store.driver "postgres") .Values.postgresql.wait.enabled }}
{{- if or $needPostgresWait .Values.cluster.enabled }}
initContainers:
  {{- if $needPostgresWait }}
  - name: wait-for-postgresql
    {{- /* … existing … */ -}}
  - name: wait-for-observer-schema
    {{- /* … existing … */ -}}
  {{- end }}
  {{- if .Values.cluster.enabled }}
  - name: assert-cluster-secret
    image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag | default .Chart.AppVersion }}"
    imagePullPolicy: {{ .Values.image.pullPolicy }}
    command: ["/bin/sh", "-ec"]
    args:
      - |
        test -n "$CHECK_VAL" || (
          echo "{{ .Values.cluster.secretEnv }} env var is empty;"
          echo "check that the Secret (configured or external) has key {{ default "cluster-secret" .Values.cluster.secretKey }}"
          exit 1
        ) >&2
    env:
      - name: CHECK_VAL
        valueFrom:
          secretKeyRef:
            name: {{ default (include "observer.configSecretName" .) .Values.existingSecret }}
            key: {{ default "cluster-secret" .Values.cluster.secretKey }}
  {{- end }}
{{- end }}
```

Container envs:

```gotemplate
{{- if .Values.cluster.enabled }}
- name: POD_IP
  valueFrom:
    fieldRef:
      fieldPath: status.podIP
- name: {{ .Values.cluster.advertiseUrlEnv }}
  value: "http://$(POD_IP):{{ .Values.cluster.internalServicePort }}"
- name: {{ .Values.cluster.secretEnv }}
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: {{ default (include "observer.configSecretName" .) .Values.existingSecret }}
      key: {{ default "cluster-secret" .Values.cluster.secretKey }}
{{- if .Values.cluster.prevSecretEnv }}
- name: {{ .Values.cluster.prevSecretEnv }}
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: {{ default (include "observer.configSecretName" .) .Values.existingSecret }}
      key: {{ default "cluster-secret-prev" .Values.cluster.prevSecretKey }}
      optional: true
{{- end }}
{{- end }}
```

Container ports:

```gotemplate
- name: http
  containerPort: {{ .Values.service.port }}
{{- if .Values.cluster.enabled }}
- name: internal
  containerPort: {{ .Values.cluster.internalServicePort }}
{{- end }}
```

Rolling-update strategy (new top-level block in deployment.yaml spec):

```gotemplate
{{- if .Values.cluster.enabled }}
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxUnavailable: 0
    maxSurge: 100%
{{- end }}
```

**Honest scope note:** even with `maxUnavailable: 0, maxSurge: 100%`, there is a window where old pods are still serving traffic (and not writing to `commander_daemons`) while new pods are also serving. Old-pod daemons remain invisible to new pods during that window, which is typically 30-120s. The spec does NOT claim this collapses to zero; the goal is to bound it. Production rollout doc (`deploy/README.md`) tells operators to drain daemon WS connections by `kubectl rollout restart` once new pods are all Ready, forcing daemons to reconnect to new pods.

#### Internal NetworkPolicy (codex MAJOR #15)

A new `templates/networkpolicy.yaml` restricts the internal port to traffic from pods labeled `app.kubernetes.io/component: observer` in the same namespace. Without this, any pod in the cluster could call the forward endpoint (defended only by HMAC). Network-layer isolation is the proper second factor.

```gotemplate
{{- if and .Values.cluster.enabled .Values.cluster.networkPolicy.enabled }}
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: {{ include "observer.fullname" . }}-internal
  labels:
    {{- include "observer.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      {{- include "observer.selectorLabels" . | nindent 6 }}
      app.kubernetes.io/component: observer
  policyTypes: [Ingress]
  ingress:
    # Rule 1: public observer port — allow from ANYWHERE (Ingress, Gateway,
    # daemon clients, in-cluster probes). NetworkPolicy without this rule
    # would deny public traffic to selected pods (codex round-3 BLOCKER #4).
    - ports:
        - port: {{ .Values.service.port }}
          protocol: TCP
    # Rule 2: internal port — restrict to observer pods only (peers).
    - ports:
        - port: {{ .Values.cluster.internalServicePort }}
          protocol: TCP
      from:
        - podSelector:
            matchLabels:
              {{- include "observer.selectorLabels" . | nindent 14 }}
              app.kubernetes.io/component: observer
{{- end }}
```

The two-rule shape is critical: a NetworkPolicy with one rule selecting target pods + ingress-restricting only port 8091 implicitly DENIES all other ingress to those pods (Kubernetes default-deny semantics for selected pods). Rule 1 explicitly allows public 8090 from anywhere; Rule 2 restricts 8091 to observer pods.

`values.yaml` adds: `cluster.networkPolicy.enabled: true` default; operators on CNIs that don't enforce NetworkPolicy (e.g. flannel without `--with-network-policy`) explicitly set `false`. The chart's README documents this prerequisite. **NetworkPolicy is defense in depth** — the HMAC + nonce + loopback-only check on /drain is the primary auth.

`values.yaml` adds:

```yaml
cluster:
  networkPolicy:
    enabled: true   # operators in clusters without a CNI that enforces
                    # NetworkPolicy (e.g. flannel without `--with-network-policy`)
                    # must explicitly disable
```

Note: NetworkPolicy enforcement requires a CNI that implements it (Cilium yes; flannel-default no). The chart's README documents this prerequisite. NetworkPolicy is defense in depth; the HMAC + nonce check is the primary defense.

#### Internal Service — headless

```gotemplate
{{- if .Values.cluster.enabled }}
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: {{ default (printf "%s-headless" (include "observer.fullname" .)) .Values.cluster.headlessServiceName }}
  labels:
    {{- include "observer.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  clusterIP: None                       # headless: DNS resolves all pod IPs
  publishNotReadyAddresses: true        # forward to terminating pods too
  ports:
    - name: internal
      port: {{ .Values.cluster.internalServicePort }}
      targetPort: internal
      protocol: TCP
  selector:
    {{- include "observer.selectorLabels" . | nindent 4 }}
    app.kubernetes.io/component: observer
{{- end }}
```

Pods discover peer IPs from `commander_daemons.owning_instance_url` (advertised pod IP). The headless Service makes those IPs DNS-queryable by name for any operator debugging. Forwarding itself dials the IP directly — no DNS dependency.

#### Ingress/HTTPRoute hardening

For **`templates/ingress.yaml`** (nginx-ingress):
```gotemplate
{{- if and .Values.ingress.enabled }}
  {{- /* Add a more-specific Ingress rule that returns 404 for the internal path. */ -}}
  {{- /* nginx-ingress merges Ingress rules; a more-specific path wins. */ -}}
spec:
  rules:
    - host: {{ .Values.ingress.host }}
      http:
        paths:
          - path: /api/commander/_internal/
            pathType: Prefix
            backend:
              service:
                # Point at a non-existent in-cluster Service to get 503/404 at the edge.
                name: {{ include "observer.fullname" . }}-deny
                port: { number: 1 }
          - path: /
            pathType: Prefix
            backend: ...   # existing public backend
{{- end }}
```

For **`templates/httproute.yaml`** (Gateway API):
```gotemplate
spec:
  rules:
    - matches:
        - path: { type: PathPrefix, value: /api/commander/_internal/ }
      filters:
        - type: ResponseHeaderModifier
          responseHeaderModifier:
            set:
              - { name: Content-Type, value: application/json }
      # No backendRefs ⇒ Gateway returns 503 (Gateway API spec).
    - matches:
        - path: { type: PathPrefix, value: / }
      backendRefs: [ … existing public … ]
```

A more-specific path with no backend is the canonical Gateway-API deny. Verified against the Gateway API v1 spec.

#### Chart tests (`tests/chart_test.sh`)

### CI workflow changes

**`.github/workflows/observer-deploy.yml`:**

- **Smoke job, `Generate smoke values` step (existing block at lines 85-149):**
  - Add `cluster_secret = "".join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for _ in range(48))` and `cluster_secret_prev = ""` to the secret-generation block at lines 88-96.
  - Add `print(f"::add-mask::{cluster_secret}")` immediately after generation.
  - Change `"replicaCount": 1` (line 99) → `"replicaCount": 2`.
  - In the `values` dict: `"cluster": {"enabled": True}` and `values["secret"]["clusterSecret"] = cluster_secret`.

- **Smoke probe job (existing `Smoke from cluster` step starting line 173, in-cluster wget at lines 204-210):**
  - Resolve pod IPs **in the GitHub runner step** (which has kubectl + kubeconfig), not in the busybox Job:
    ```yaml
    - name: Resolve smoke pod IPs
      run: |
        kubectl --context "$KUBE_CONTEXT" -n "$OBSERVER_NAMESPACE" \
          get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=$SMOKE_RELEASE,app.kubernetes.io/component=observer \
          -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.status.podIP} {end}' > /tmp/observer-pod-ips
        cat /tmp/observer-pod-ips
    - name: Smoke from cluster
      run: |
        ips="$(cat /tmp/observer-pod-ips)"
        # Render per-pod-IP wget commands into the busybox Job manifest:
        cmds=""
        for ip in $ips; do
          cmds="$cmds wget -qO- http://$ip:8090/readyz;"
        done
        cat >/tmp/observer-smoke-job.yaml <<EOF
        … (existing template) …
        args:
          - |
            $cmds
        EOF
    ```
  - Asserts each pod's readiness independent of LB routing without giving the busybox Job kubectl access (which it cannot have anyway).

- **Release job (existing block starting line 233):**
  - Add `"OBSERVER_CLUSTER_SECRET"` to the `required = [...]` list (line 285-291); `"OBSERVER_CLUSTER_SECRET_PREV"` is **not required** (rotation-only).
  - Pull from `${{ secrets.OBSERVER_CLUSTER_SECRET }}` as env at line 273-279; mask via `::add-mask::` immediately.
  - Populate `values["secret"]["clusterSecret"]` and `values["cluster"]={"enabled": True}`.
  - If `${{ secrets.OBSERVER_CLUSTER_SECRET_PREV }}` is set (rotation window), populate `values["secret"]["clusterSecretPrev"]` too.

**`.github/workflows/multi-agent.yml`:** no required changes. `go test ./...` runs every test including the new `multi_pod_test.go`. The `helm` job (line 54) re-runs `chart_test.sh`.

### Data flow walkthroughs

**1. UI lists daemons:**
1. UI → LB → Pod B → `GET /api/commander/daemons`.
2. `ch.daemons` calls `ch.hub.listDaemons(r.Context(), o)`.
3. Shared mode: `sharedReg.listAll(ctx, o)` runs `SELECT … WHERE last_seen_at > now() - 45s`. Returns full list across pods.
4. PG unreachable: returns empty + `X-Observer-Registry-Degraded: true`; HTTP 200; UI shows "no daemons" instead of 500.

**2. UI runs a turn on a daemon owned by Pod A, request lands on Pod B:**
1. UI → LB → Pod B → `POST /api/commander/daemons/<id>/sessions/<sid>/turn`.
2. `ch.turn` calls `hub.lookupDaemon(r.Context(), o, daemonID)` → `{PeerURL: "http://10.0.1.42:8091", …}`.
3. `ch.hub.turns.begin(key)` — Postgres-backed in shared mode, ATOMIC across pods: Pod B's INSERT-on-conflict returns true; a duplicate from Pod C (or even Pod B's second tab) returns false → 409 "turn already in flight". This is the multi-pod dedup that v2 explicitly left out and v3 fixes.
4. `SendCommandStream(ctx, o, daemonID, "session_turn", args)`. Local lookup misses → shared lookup returns peer → forward client opens POST to `http://10.0.1.42:8091/api/commander/_internal/forward` with streaming=true.
5. Pod A's `/api/commander/_internal/forward` handler:
   - Validates HMAC + timestamp + nonce-insert.
   - Reads body (1.5 MiB cap).
   - Validates daemon is in Pod A's `localReg` (404 otherwise).
   - Calls `hub.sendCommandStreamToLocal(ctx, dc, "session_turn", args, outBuffer=256)`.
   - Drains the returned channel and writes length-prefixed JSON to the chunked HTTP body.
   - Each frame routed by Pod A's `routeFrame`. Because Pod A's `pendingEntry.command="session_turn"` and sessionID is known, terminal/status frames trigger `hub.turns.updateFromEnvelope(...)` ON POD A — turn state in `commander_turns` reflects Pod A as source-of-truth.
6. Pod B's forward client decodes envelopes and emits on the `<-chan` returned from `SendCommandStream`. `ch.turn` writes SSE to the browser.
7. Terminal frame → forward client closes its read, drain exits on `ok=false` from `out`.

**3. UI on Pod C polls `/tree` mid-turn:**
1. `ch.tree` → `CommanderTree(ctx, o)` → `listDaemons(...)` returns daemons from all pods.
2. For each, `daemonTree(ctx, o, info)` calls `cachedSessionRows` — in shared mode, cache is nil, so always refresh: `SendCommand("list_sessions")` either local or forwarded.
3. Per-row turn state read from `commander_turns` via `hub.turns.get(key)` — which is the Postgres-backed read. Sees the in-flight turn updated by Pod A's routeFrame in step 5/6.

**4. Pod A crashes mid-turn:**
1. Pod B's forward client `io.EOF` → synthesize error envelope → close chan.
2. `ch.turn` emits SSE error.
3. `commander_turns` row for that key has `state='queued'|'answering'` and isn't being updated. `hub.turns.cleanupOrphans()` (new background sweep) flips rows older than `Hub.TurnTimeout` (10min) to `state='disconnected'`. **Caveat:** this is the worst surviving inconsistency — a daemon row could show `state='answering'` for up to 10 minutes after a crash. Acceptable for the user-visible bug fix; tracked.
4. `commander_daemons` row for Pod A's daemons gets cleaned up by sweep at the 5-min boundary.

**5. Daemon fast reconnect Pod A → Pod B:**
1. Daemon's WS dies, reconnects, lands on Pod B (LB choice).
2. Pod B `localReg.add(dc)` + `sharedReg.connectUpsert` → row's `owning_instance_url` is now Pod B.
3. Pod A's deferred `sharedReg.remove(o, daemonID)` runs but the DELETE's `WHERE owning_instance_url=podA` filter affects 0 rows. Safe.
4. Pod A's heartbeat goroutine: cancelled by `hbCancel`, exits before the deferred DELETE; the last UPSERT attempt (if mid-flight) returns 0 affected rows under the `WHERE owning_instance_url=EXCLUDED.owning_instance_url` ownership guard → heartbeat treats 0 as "ownership lost" and exits without log spam.

**6. Secret rotation:**
1. Ops sets `cluster-secret-prev` key in `existingSecret` to the old secret value; `cluster-secret` to the new value. Trigger rollout.
2. New pods come up with `Secret=new, PrevSecret=old`. They accept HMAC from old-secret-only senders (the not-yet-rolled pods).
3. Old pods are being terminated; they send with their `Secret=old`. New pods accept under `PrevSecret`.
4. After rollout completes, ops removes `cluster-secret-prev`; next rollout pods have `PrevSecret=nil`.

**7. PG outage during heartbeat:**
1. Heartbeat fails for 60s. Counter `forward.heartbeat_errors` increments per failed UPSERT. WARN log rate-limited to 1/sec/pod.
2. `listAll` from any pod stops returning the affected daemons after `last_seen_at > now() - 45s`.
3. **Sweep does NOT delete** (>5min threshold). Rows preserved.
4. PG recovers, next heartbeat UPSERTs `last_seen_at = now()`. Daemons reappear immediately.

### Testing

**Unit (no Postgres):**
- `registry_shared_test.go` — `go-sqlmock` against `*sql.DB`: assert ownership-guarded UPSERT/heartbeat/DELETE/sweep SQL; assert `lookupRemote` returns false for self-owned rows.
- `forward_test.go` — `httptest`-driven round-trip; HMAC valid/invalid; timestamp drift > 60s → 403; nonce replay → 403; body > 1.5 MiB → 413; receiver not in shared mode → 503; caller cancel propagates; slow reader triggers drop counter + synthetic `truncated` envelope; daemon-error code preserved across the wire.
- `turn_state_pg_test.go` — `go-sqlmock`: begin returns true on first call, false on conflict; rekey moves key atomically; cleanupOrphans flips stale rows.

**Integration (Postgres via env-skip pattern; mirrors `authstore/postgres_test.go:15-23`):**
- `multi_pod_test.go` — boot two `Hub` instances against shared PG + shared `clusterSecret`. Mock daemon connects to Hub A. Assert:
  - Hub B `listDaemons(o)` returns 1 row.
  - Hub B `SendCommand("list_sessions")` succeeds via forwarding.
  - Hub B `SendCommandStream("session_turn")` receives all envelopes; turn-state in `commander_turns` updated by Hub A.
  - Concurrent `turns.begin(same key)` on Hub A and Hub B — only one returns true.
  - Kill Hub A; sweep on Hub B removes row after `deleteAfter` (use injected `time.Now` faker).
  - Reconnect daemon to Hub B; ownership flipped; Hub A (relaunched) lookups now hit Hub B.
- `multi_pod_files_test.go` — forward a `read_file` of a 2 MiB pathological text file (all `0x01` bytes); assert response has `TooLarge=true, Content=""` and the wire frame stayed under 1 MiB. Also forward a normal 200 KiB text file and assert the content is transparently passed through.

**Local repro:** `dev/compose.multi-observer.yaml` boots PG + 2 observers + nginx LB; `dev/README.md` documents `make multi-observer-up`.

**Existing tests:** unchanged. `*_test.go` calls to `hub.reg.{add,daemons,lookup,remove}` still compile because the method surface is preserved on `*localRegistry`.

### Verification

CI:
- `helm` job's `chart_test.sh` covers cluster env + internal Service + fail-fast rendering.
- `go` job's `go test ./...` covers unit; integration tests gated on `OBSERVER_POSTGRES_TEST_DSN` env (skipped on PRs without; run on smoke/release jobs).

Smoke cluster:
```sh
kubectl -n dev-yuzishu get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=observer-ci-<run> \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/component=observer    # 2 pods Running
kubectl -n dev-yuzishu get svc | grep observer-headless    # headless Service exists
curl -sf https://<public-host>/api/commander/_internal/forward    # 404 (Ingress hardened)
kubectl -n dev-yuzishu exec <pg-pod> -- psql "$DSN" -c '\d commander_daemons commander_turns commander_forward_nonces'

# Connect a driver-agent at the public host; 30 GETs → length stable.
for i in {1..30}; do
  curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "https://<public-host>/api/commander/daemons" \
    | jq '.daemons | length'
done | sort -u | wc -l    # → 1

# Run 10 turns; none should 404.
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -sf -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    "https://<public-host>/api/commander/daemons/<id>/sessions/<sid>/turn" \
    -d '{"prompt":"hello"}' >/dev/null || echo "FAIL on iter $i"
done

# Re-do above with two daemons + concurrent two-tab turn POST → exactly one
# should 409 ("turn already in flight"). Other should succeed.
```

Local:
```sh
docker compose -f dev/compose.multi-observer.yaml up -d
for i in {1..30}; do
  curl -s http://localhost:8090/api/commander/daemons | jq '.daemons | length'
done | sort -u | wc -l    # → 1
```

Automated regression:
```sh
go test ./internal/commanderhub/... -race -count=1
OBSERVER_POSTGRES_TEST_DSN=... go test -run TestMultiPod -race ./internal/commanderhub/...
```

### Threat model — cluster secret compromise (codex round-3 MAJOR #8)

**Trust boundary:** the cluster secret authenticates pod-to-pod forwarding. A holder of the cluster secret can:
- Forge a `forward` request with arbitrary `user_id` and `workspace_id`, **provided the target daemon (`short_id`) is in the target pod's local registry**.
- Cause the target pod to execute commands (list_sessions, get_session, list_files, read_file, session_turn) on that daemon AS the impersonated owner.
- Receive the daemon's response (file content, session contents, turn output).

**This is functionally equivalent to a full-cluster compromise** for the commander surface. The cluster secret must be treated as a high-value credential, on par with the Postgres DSN and S3 keys.

**Mitigations in v5:**
1. **Network isolation** via NetworkPolicy restricts the internal listener to observer pods only. A compromised non-observer pod cannot reach the listener.
2. **Audit log** records every accepted forward with (`user_id`, `workspace_id`, `short_id`, `command`, `peer remote_addr`). Detection post-compromise, not prevention.
3. **Three-phase rotation procedure** lets ops rotate quickly when compromise is suspected.
4. **Sender-side and receiver-side audit** lets ops correlate "this request appeared at pod B from a peer not in our pod set."

**NOT mitigated** (documented limitations):
- **No per-tenant authorization beyond the daemon's owner check.** A cluster-secret holder who knows a target tenant's `(user_id, workspace_id, short_id)` triple can issue commands. The triple is not secret — short_id is visible in the commander UI's daemon list. Strong tenant-isolation would require per-tenant capability tokens stored in the registry row and checked by the receiver. Spec'd as **follow-up issue** (cap-token registry).
- **Network policy not enforced** by all CNIs. Operators on flannel-without-`--with-network-policy` get no network-layer defense. Documented; ops responsibility.

**Rotation playbook** (`deploy/README.md`):
- Suspected compromise: rotate cluster secret via three-phase procedure (Phase A → B → C in §"Three-phase secret rotation"); minimum 6 minutes total.
- Confirmed compromise: rotate secret AND audit `forward.received` logs for the 24 h preceding detection; manually review the listed commands per (user, workspace) and notify any tenant whose data was accessed.

### Out of scope (follow-up issues)

- **Per-tenant capability tokens** (codex round-3 MAJOR #8 ultimate fix) — currently a cluster-secret holder can impersonate any tenant. Follow-up adds a per-(user,workspace,short_id) capability token stored with the registry row, signed by the owning pod, included in `forward` body, and verified by the receiver. Real defense against secret leakage. Requires careful key management.
- **mTLS between pods** — HMAC + nonce + non-public Service is adequate for cluster-internal traffic; mTLS via cert-manager is a separate sprint.
- **Headless-DNS-based addressing for forwarding** — pod IPs via downward API + headless Service for discovery is simpler; revisit if pod IP churn becomes a real problem.
- **`cleanupOrphans` for `commander_turns`** — basic implementation in v5 (flip to `disconnected` after `TurnTimeout`); a follow-up could improve UX by linking the orphan to its `commander_daemons` row and flipping when the daemon row disappears.
- **PG-backed session-list cache** — v5 simply disables the cache in shared mode. A follow-up could add a generation column for shared invalidation if `list_sessions` traffic becomes hot.
- **Daemon-side file_read encoded-size enforcement test coverage** — v5 adds the enforcement in `commander/files.go`; integration test against a 2 MiB control-byte file is a small follow-up.

### Rollout sequence

1. **Pre-merge ops work:**
   - Add `OBSERVER_CLUSTER_SECRET` to GitHub repo secrets (smoke + release).
   - Add `cluster-secret` key to production `existingSecret` (`observer-production-secret`).
2. **Merge.** CI builds image and runs smoke at `replicaCount=2` with auto-generated secret.
3. **Production release deploy** (`workflow_dispatch` with `target: release`): Helm `upgrade --install` with `maxUnavailable: 0, maxSurge: 100%` (set in chart when `cluster.enabled=true`). New pods come up alongside old, drain, then old pods terminate.
4. **Post-deploy verification:** the curl loops above; check `commander_daemons` row count matches connected daemon count; spot-check that turns succeed regardless of which pod the POST lands on.
5. **Honest mixed-version window** (codex MAJOR #16 — v3 wrongly claimed `kubectl rollout restart` collapses the window). During a Helm `RollingUpdate` with `maxUnavailable: 0, maxSurge: 100%`, the actual sequence is:
   - t=0: old pods are Ready and serving traffic; they do NOT write `commander_daemons`.
   - t=0–60s: new pods come up; pass readiness (DB ping + cluster init container); start receiving LB traffic.
   - t=60–120s: old pods are gracefully terminated; their daemon WS connections drop; daemons reconnect.
   - On reconnect, the LB hashes daemons across the now-only-new pods, which UPSERT `commander_daemons`.
   - **During t=0–120s, UI requests landing on new pods see ONLY the daemons that have reconnected. Daemons still on old pods are invisible.** This is genuinely unavoidable for a rolling update where the old image doesn't know about the shared table.
   - To shorten the window: a new `preStop` lifecycle hook on old pods sends `commander.CloseEnvelope` to every WS daemon before exiting, forcing immediate reconnect. The chart adds this preStop only when `cluster.enabled=true`. Window collapses to ~5s instead of ~60s.
   - To eliminate the window: blue/green with a manual cutover. Out of scope for this PR; documented as a follow-up in `deploy/README.md` for future high-availability rollouts.

```gotemplate
{{- if .Values.cluster.enabled }}
lifecycle:
  preStop:
    # Use exec with the observer-server binary's --drain-local subcommand
    # (codex round-4 MAJOR #2 correction: Kubernetes httpGet runs from
    # the kubelet, not in the container; host:127.0.0.1 would resolve to
    # the node, not the pod). exec runs inside the container, so it can
    # POST to 127.0.0.1:8091 over loopback and trigger the drain handler's
    # loopback bypass.
    exec:
      command:
        - /usr/local/bin/observer-server
        - --config
        - /etc/observer/observer.yaml
        - --drain-local
        - --internal-port={{ .Values.cluster.internalServicePort }}
{{- end }}
```

The observer-server binary gains a `--drain-local` flag. Behavior:

1. Reads the observer's main config (same `--config` path as the main server) and extracts `cluster.internal_listen_addr` (or its env-var resolution). Parses the address; **`drain-local` requires the address's host portion to be empty (`:8091`), `0.0.0.0`, or `127.0.0.1`** — anything else means the internal listener is not bound to loopback and drain cannot work locally.
2. **`validateConfig` enforces this at observer startup too** (codex round-5 MAJOR #4): if `cluster.internal_listen_addr` is set to a non-loopback-covering address (e.g. `10.0.0.42:8091`), the observer refuses to start with a fatal `"cluster.internal_listen_addr must bind to all interfaces or loopback so preStop drain can reach it; got <addr>"`. Operators wanting bind to a specific pod IP must use a sidecar/inspect override (out of scope; documented).
3. Issues `POST http://127.0.0.1:<port>/api/commander/_internal/drain` using `net/http`.
4. Exits 0 on 200; logs and exits 0 on connect error (preStop is best-effort; the pod terminates regardless).
5. **Config-read errors cause exit 1** (codex round-6 MAJOR #3): if the binary cannot read or parse its config (e.g. `--config` mount missing in preStop ctx, malformed YAML), it exits 1 so kubelet logs a `FailedPreStopHook` event. The pod still terminates within `terminationGracePeriodSeconds`. Connection errors AFTER successful config read are still tolerated (exit 0 with WARN log) since the listener may already be shutting down.

Implementation: a small Go subcommand in `cmd/observer-server/drain_local.go` (new). After `preStop`, kubelet's `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` (default 30 s, override via chart `values.yaml::terminationGracePeriodSeconds`) elapses before SIGKILL. Our observer's `http.Server.Shutdown` handles the rest.

A new endpoint `/api/commander/_internal/drain` lives on the INTERNAL mux. **Auth (codex round-3 BLOCKER #3):** by default requires the same HMAC+nonce auth as `/forward`, because the internal listener binds `0.0.0.0:8091` and is reachable from any cluster pod (NetworkPolicy is defense-in-depth, not the primary auth). A special-case exemption: requests whose `RemoteAddr` resolves to a loopback address (`127.0.0.0/8` or `::1`) skip HMAC — this is the preStop hook calling itself.

```go
// drainHandler v5: require HMAC unless source is loopback.
func (h *Hub) drainHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    if !isLoopback(r.RemoteAddr) {
        if err := verifyForwardAuth(r, h.cluster.Secret, h.cluster.PrevSecret); err != nil {
            http.Error(w, "unauthorized", http.StatusForbidden)
            auditLog("drain.denied", r.RemoteAddr, err)
            return
        }
    }
    h.drainAllLocalDaemons("observer-restart")
    auditLog("drain.executed", r.RemoteAddr, nil)
    w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
}
```

`isLoopback` parses the host portion of `r.RemoteAddr` and checks `net.IP.IsLoopback`. Standard pattern.

`drainAllLocalDaemons` iterates `localRegistry`, for each WS writes a `{type:"event",payload:{event_kind:"observer_draining","text":"observer-restart"}}` envelope (informational; the daemon's wsclient.Run hits read EOF on the subsequent conn.Close), then `dc.conn.Close()`. `wsclient.Run` reconnects with backoff (`commander/wsclient.go:88`).

**Three layers** of drain protection: loopback restriction (preStop only) + HMAC (cluster peers if any) + NetworkPolicy (CNI defense in depth). A pod in the same namespace cannot drain another pod's daemons without the cluster secret.

Rollback: `helm rollback observer <prev>`. New tables (`commander_daemons`, `commander_turns`, `commander_forward_nonces`) are left behind (no down migration in the chart); rows become stale, irrelevant. A subsequent re-roll-forward consumes them harmlessly. Manual down migration (`schema_postgres_rollback.sql`) is documented in `deploy/README.md`.
